# Java Inventory Manager 
This project is something I worked on a little bit ago, and added to it as time went on. I currently have no plans to continue to update it but if I ever get a Java itch It's something I'll return to. 

# Features
The inventory manager features the following functions
* File IO in JSON, txt, and CSV formats
* Ability for serial number generation
* Sort the items in the list by certain criteria
* Functional UI
